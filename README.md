* [x] build yaml configs for optical system description
* [ ] add glass
  * [x] check all glass catalogs reader
  * [ ] add interpolation for refractive index
* [ ] add ray tracing through seq system
* [ ] add plot of optical elements
* [ ] add plot of ray tracing
* [ ] implement classes of optical elements: lenses, plates, image plane
* [ ] add glass classes
* [ ] add Thorlabs elements from catalog
* [ ] add catalog examples of lenses, devices, glasses, etc.
* add [zemax](https://support.zemax.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005486681-Zemax-file-extensions) file formats reading if possible:
  * [ ] ZMX - ascii specs are opened

  * [ ] ZMF - glass catalogs
* [ ] add global constants
* [ ] test system
* [ ] doc system
* [ ] FDTD
